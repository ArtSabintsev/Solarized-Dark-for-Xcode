Solarized Dark for Xcode
========================

![Solarized Dark Screen Shot](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Solarized-Dark-for-Xcode/blob/master/solarizedDark.png?raw=true "Solarized Dark Screenshot")

## Note

I've moved away from using Solarized to a _Night-Shift_-friendly palette of my own creation; [Cognac](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Cognac). It's available for many editors, including [Xcode](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Cognac-Xcode).

I will still continue supporting this Solarized Dark theme for the Xcode community.

## Background
This theme works with Xcode 8, 9, and 10.

This theme used to work with Xcode 5, 6, and 7, but due to the changes to the theme editor, this theme is no longer compatible.

## Installation

### Automatic (via script)
```
./install.sh
```

which will install the file in Xcode `FontAndColorThemes` directory.

- Restart Xcode
- Go to preferences and select **Solarized Dark**

### Manual Installation
Copy the .xccolortheme file into the following directory:

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
```

- Restart Xcode
- Go to preferences and select **Solarized Dark**
